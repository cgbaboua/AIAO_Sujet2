# Child Mind Institute - Detect Sleep States 

**Authors**: ABDI Feriel, BENKORTEBI Manel, GBABOUA Cassandra, LEBIB Inès

## Summary

### Project Overview
This project is an intersection of academic coursework and competitive research. It falls under the [`BQ4CY030 Apprentissage, Intelligence artificielle et Optimisation 1`](https://moodle.u-paris.fr/course/view.php?id=4162) course at Paris Cité University and is also part of a code [`competition`](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/child-mind-institute-detect-sleep-states/overview) hosted by the Child Mind Institute.

#### Objectives

- **Academic:** To explore and implement machine learning algorithms such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Random Forest, and Logistic Regression for sleep state detection.
  
- **Competitive:** To focus on the average precision of detected sleep and wake events as per the competition’s evaluation metric.

#### Impact

The work aims to enhance the reliability of large-scale sleep studies. It holds particular significance for healthcare, especially concerning mood and behavior difficulties in children and adolescents.

## System Requirements
This program is compatible with macOS and UNIX-based operating systems. Windows users can run this project using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).
